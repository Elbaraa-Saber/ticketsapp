# This task for flight tickets
#### Firstly i want to say that i had some problems with Api so i tried to conect with anothers Api but didn't got and Code in the Component which called{Tickets} but i didin't use it component,
##### so i took information which i got from Api on Postman and i did for myself json file in my github and tood information form there.<a href="https://github.com/Elbaraa-Saber/ticketsFakeApi/blob/main/data.json">data.json</a>

#### Second I didn't notice that the task required a multiple-choice list, and I did it as a single checklist.

#### I also had some problems connecting some pages to each other in React when there is javascript code,
##### So I didn't shorten and minimize Components as I should.
